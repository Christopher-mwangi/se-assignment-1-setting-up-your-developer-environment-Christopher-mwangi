#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

   Download and Install Windows 11
Step 1: Check System Requirements and Compatibility:
Before initiating the installation process, ensure that your PC meets the minimum system requirements for Windows 11. You can use the PC Health Check app from Microsoft to verify compatibility.
Step 2: Back Up Your Data:
It is crucial to back up your important data before proceeding. This ensures that even if something goes wrong during the installation, your files remain safe. You can use an external hard drive, cloud storage, or any other preferred method to back up your data.
Step 3: Download the Windows 11 Installation Media:
There are several ways to obtain the Windows 11 installation files. Here are a few common methods:
•	Windows Update: If you are already running Windows 10, go to Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update. Click on "Check for updates" and follow the prompts to upgrade to Windows 11 if it is available for your device.
•	Installation Assistant: Visit the Microsoft Windows 11 download website and click on the "Download Now" button under the "Windows 11 Installation Assistant" section. This tool will guide you through the installation process and is ideal if you don't see the update in Windows Update.
•	Media Creation Tool: Microsoft also offers a media creation tool that allows you to create a bootable USB drive or ISO file for a clean installation of Windows 11. This method will erase your files, so ensure you have a backup.
Step 4: Initiate the Installation:
Once you have obtained the installation files, you can proceed with the installation. The process will vary slightly depending on the method chosen:
•	Windows Update: If Windows Update shows the availability of Windows 11, click on the "Download and install" option. After the download is complete, restart your PC to begin the installation process.
•	Installation Assistant: Run the downloaded installation assistant and follow the on-screen instructions. It will guide you through the installation process, including accepting the license terms and initiating the installation.
•	Media Creation Tool: If you created a bootable USB drive using the media creation tool, connect the USB drive to your PC and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows 11.
Step 5: Follow the On-Screen Instructions:
During the installation process, you will be guided through a series of steps, including language and keyboard layout selection, accepting the license terms, and choosing the installation type (upgrade or custom installation). Make your selections carefully and follow the prompts.
Step 6: Wait for the Installation to Complete:
The installation process may take some time, and your PC will restart several times. Do not interrupt the process and ensure your device remains connected to a power source.
Step 7: Set Up Windows 11:
Once the installation is complete, you will be guided through the initial setup process, including creating a user account, configuring settings, and personalizing your device.
Step 8: Install Necessary Drivers and Updates:
After setting up Windows 11, ensure that you install the necessary device drivers and check for any available Windows updates to ensure your system is up to date.
Step 9: Restore Your Data:
If you performed a clean installation and backed up your data, you can now restore your files to the new Windows 11 installation.
Step 10: Explore and Customize:
Finally, take some time to explore the new features and interface of Windows 11. You can customize your settings, themes, and other preferences to make the operating system your own.

Step 7: Launch Visual Studio Code:
After installation, you can launch Visual Studio Code by double-clicking on the VS Code icon or by searching for it in your Start menu or Applications folder, depending on your operating system.



3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com


   Set Up Version Control System: Install Git
Step 1: Understand Version Control and Git:
Version control systems allow you to track changes to your codebase over time, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions of your project. Git is one of the most widely used version control systems, known for its flexibility, efficiency, and distributed nature. 

Step 2: Check System Requirements:
Ensure that your computer meets the minimum system requirements for installing Git. Git is supported on various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can find the specific requirements on the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/). 

Step 3: Download the Git Installer:
Go to the official Git website (https://git-scm.com/) and click on the "Downloads" section. Select the appropriate download link for your operating system. If you are using Windows, you will find the "Git for Windows" installer. For macOS, you can install Git through the package manager (e.g., Homebrew) or download the installer. Linux users can install Git through the package manager of their distribution. 

Step 4: Install Git:
Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard. The installation process will vary depending on your operating system: 
- Windows: Double-click on the downloaded ".exe" file and follow the installation prompts. You may be asked to configure settings, such as the default text editor and the "Git Bash" terminal. 

Step 5: Configure Git (Optional):
After installation, you can configure your Git settings, such as your user name and email address. Open a terminal or Git Bash prompt and use the following commands: 
- "git config --global user.name "Your Name"" 
- "git config --global user.email "your@email.com"" 

You can also set other configuration options, such as default text editor, line endings, and more, using the "git config" command. 

Step 6: Verify Git Installation:
To ensure that Git was installed successfully, open a terminal or Git Bash prompt and type: "git --version". This will display the installed Git version. 


Step 7: Create a Git Repository:
Now that Git is installed, you can start using it for version control. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal. Initialize a new Git repository with the command: "git init". This will create a hidden ".git" directory in your project folder, which contains all the necessary metadata for version control. 

Step 8: Start Tracking Changes:
Add files to your project directory and use Git commands to track changes. Use "git add <file_name>" to stage changes for the next commit. Then, use "git commit -m "Your commit message"" to create a new commit with the staged changes. You can also use "git commit -a -m "Your commit message"" to add and commit changes in one step. 


Step 9: Connect to a Remote Repository (Optional)
If you plan to collaborate with others or use a remote repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), you can connect your local Git repository to a remote one. Use "git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>" to set up the connection. Then, you can push your local changes to the remote repository with "git push origin master" (assuming "origin" is the name of your remote repository).
